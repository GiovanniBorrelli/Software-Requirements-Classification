# Software-Requirements-Classification
Software requirements are documented and detailed specifications that define the functionalities, performances, constraints, and other characteristics of a software system. These requirements provide clear and understandable guidance for developers during the software design and development process, ensuring that the final product meets user expectations and project objectives. Software requirements serve as a fundamental basis for planning and implementing a software application.

The objective of this project is to automate the process of identifying parts of speech that indicate the presence of software requirements, thereby simplifying the work for software engineers.
